---

 Dataset Description
The `netflix_cleaned1.csv` file contains a curated list of titles and their corresponding release years, likely derived from a larger Netflix database. It appears to be a summary of the number of titles released per year, though some rows list a single title with its year.

 Columns
The dataset includes two primary columns:

-   **Row Labels**: This column appears to contain the title of the movie or show.
-   **Sum of release_year**: This column represents the release year for each title.

 Preprocessing and Data Cleaning
Based on the file content, the data seems to have undergone a cleaning process. It is a simplified version of a more complex dataset, focusing solely on the titles and their release years.

 Possible Use Cases
This dataset can be used for various data analysis tasks, such as:

-   Analyzing the number of titles released annually.
-   Identifying the most prolific years for Netflix content.
-   Creating visualizations to show trends in content production over time.
